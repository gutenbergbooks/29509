<h1><big>warm</big></h1>

<h2><small>By ROBERT SHECKLEY</small></h2>

<div class="bk1"><p><big><b><i>It was a joyous journey Anders
set out on ... to reach his goal
... but look where he wound up!</i></b></big></p></div>

<p class="pr1"><big><b>Illustrated by EMSH</b></big></p>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Anders</span> lay on his bed, fully
dressed except for his
shoes and black bow tie,
contemplating, with a certain uneasiness,
the evening before him.
In twenty minutes he would pick
up Judy at her apartment, and
that was the uneasy part of it.</p>

<p>He had realized, only seconds
ago, that he was in love with her.</p>

<p>Well, he'd tell her. The evening
would be memorable. He would
propose, there would be kisses,
and the seal of acceptance would,
figuratively speaking, be stamped
across his forehead.</p>

<p>Not too pleasant an outlook,
he decided. It really would be
much more comfortable not to
be in love. What had done it?
A look, a touch, a thought? It
didn't take much, he knew, and
stretched his arms for a thorough
yawn.</p>

<p>"Help me!" a voice said.</p>

<p>His muscles spasmed, cutting
off the yawn in mid-moment. He
sat upright on the bed, then
grinned and lay back again.</p>

<p>"You must help me!" the voice
insisted.</p>

<p>Anders sat up, reached for a
polished shoe and fitted it on,
giving his full attention to the
tying of the laces.</p>

<p>"Can you hear me?" the voice
asked. "You can, can't you?"</p>

<p>That did it. "Yes, I can hear
you," Anders said, still in a high
good humor. "Don't tell me
you're my guilty subconscious,
attacking me for a childhood
trauma I never bothered to resolve.
I suppose you want me to
join a monastery."</p>

<p>"I don't know what you're
talking about," the voice said.
"I'm no one's subconscious. I'm
<i>me</i>. Will you help me?"</p>

<p>Anders believed in voices as
much as anyone; that is, he didn't
believe in them at all, until he
heard them. Swiftly he catalogued
the possibilities. Schizophrenia
was the best answer, of
course, and one in which his colleagues
would concur. But Anders
had a lamentable confidence
in his own sanity. In which case&mdash;</p>

<p>"Who are you?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I don't know," the voice answered.</p>

<p>Anders realized that the voice
was speaking within his own
mind. Very suspicious.</p>

<p>"You don't know who you are,"
Anders stated. "Very well. <i>Where</i>
are you?"</p>

<p>"I don't know that, either."
The voice paused, and went on.
"Look, I know how ridiculous
this must sound. Believe me, I'm
in some sort of limbo. I don't
know how I got here or who I am,
but I want desperately to get
out. Will you help me?"</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Still</span> fighting the idea of a
voice speaking within his head,
Anders knew that his next decision
was vital. He had to accept&mdash;or
reject&mdash;his own sanity.</p>

<p>He accepted it.</p>

<p>"All right," Anders said, lacing
the other shoe. "I'll grant that
you're a person in trouble, and
that you're in some sort of telepathic
contact with me. Is there
anything else you can tell me?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid not," the voice said,
with infinite sadness. "You'll have
to find out for yourself."</p>

<p>"Can you contact anyone
else?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Then how can you talk with
me?"</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>Anders walked to his bureau
mirror and adjusted his black
bow tie, whistling softly under his
breath. Having just discovered
that he was in love, he wasn't
going to let a little thing like a
voice in his mind disturb him.</p>

<p>"I really don't see how I can
be of any help," Anders said,
brushing a bit of lint from his
jacket. "You don't know where
you are, and there don't seem to
be any distinguishing landmarks.
How am I to find you?" He
turned and looked around the
room to see if he had forgotten
anything.</p>

<p>"I'll know when you're close,"
the voice said. "You were warm
just then."</p>

<p>"Just then?" All he had done
was look around the room. He
did so again, turning his head
slowly. Then it happened.</p>

<p>The room, from one angle,
looked different. It was suddenly
a mixture of muddled colors,
instead of the carefully blended
pastel shades he had selected.
The lines of wall, floor and ceiling
were strangely off proportion,
zigzag, unrelated.</p>

<p>Then everything went back to
normal.</p>

<p>"You were <i>very</i> warm," the
voice said. "It's a question of
seeing things correctly."</p>

<p>Anders resisted the urge to
scratch his head, for fear of disarranging
his carefully combed
hair. What he had seen wasn't
so strange. Everyone sees one or
two things in his life that make
him doubt his normality, doubt
sanity, doubt his very existence.
For a moment the orderly Universe
is disarranged and the fabric
of belief is ripped.</p>

<p>But the moment passes.</p>

<p>Anders remembered once, as a
boy, awakening in his room in the
middle of the night. How strange
everything had looked. Chairs,
table, all out of proportion, swollen
in the dark. The ceiling pressing
down, as in a dream.</p>

<p>But that had also passed.</p>

<p>"Well, old man," he said, "if I
get warm again, let me know."</p>

<p>"I will," the voice in his head
whispered. "I'm sure you'll find
me."</p>

<p>"I'm glad you're so sure," Anders
said gaily, switched off the
lights and left.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Lovely</span> and smiling, Judy
greeted him at the door.
Looking at her, Anders sensed
her knowledge of the moment.
Had she felt the change in him,
or predicted it? Or was love making
him grin like an idiot?</p>

<p>"Would you like a before-party
drink?" she asked.</p>

<p>He nodded, and she led him
across the room, to the improbable
green-and-yellow couch. Sitting
down, Anders decided he
would tell her when she came
back with the drink. No use in
putting off the fatal moment. A
lemming in love, he told himself.</p>

<p>"You're getting warm again,"
the voice said.</p>

<p>He had almost forgotten his
invisible friend. Or fiend, as the
case could well be. What would
Judy say if she knew he was
hearing voices? Little things like
that, he reminded himself, often
break up the best of romances.</p>

<p>"Here," she said, handing him
a drink.</p>

<p>Still smiling, he noticed. The
number two smile&mdash;to a prospective
suitor, provocative and
understanding. It had been preceded,
in their relationship, by
the number one nice-girl smile,
the don't-misunderstand-me
smile, to be worn on all occasions,
until the correct words have been
mumbled.</p>

<p>"That's right," the voice said.
"It's in how you look at things."</p>

<p>Look at what? Anders glanced
at Judy, annoyed at his thoughts.
If he was going to play the lover,
let him play it. Even through the
astigmatic haze of love, he was
able to appreciate her blue-gray
eyes, her fine skin (if one overlooked
a tiny blemish on the left
temple), her lips, slightly reshaped
by lipstick.</p>

<p>"How did your classes go today?"
she asked.</p>

<p>Well, of course she'd ask that,
Anders thought. Love is marking
time.</p>

<p>"All right," he said. "Teaching
psychology to young apes&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, come now!"</p>

<p>"Warmer," the voice said.</p>

<p>What's the matter with me,
Anders wondered. She really is
a lovely girl. The <i>gestalt</i> that is
Judy, a pattern of thoughts, expressions,
movements, making up
the girl I&mdash;</p>

<p>I what?</p>

<p>Love?</p>

<p>Anders shifted his long body
uncertainly on the couch. He
didn't quite understand how this
train of thought had begun. It
annoyed him. The analytical
young instructor was better off
in the classroom. Couldn't science
wait until 9:10 in the morning?</p>

<p>"I was thinking about you today,"
Judy said, and Anders
knew that she had sensed the
change in his mood.</p>

<p>"Do you see?" the voice asked
him. "You're getting much better
at it."</p>

<p>"I don't see anything," Anders
thought, but the voice was right.
It was as though he had a clear
line of inspection into Judy's
mind. Her feelings were nakedly
apparent to him, as meaningless
as his room had been in that
flash of undistorted thought.</p>

<p>"I really was thinking about
you," she repeated.</p>

<p>"Now look," the voice said.</p>

<hr />

<div class="figright"><img src="images/001.png" width="357" height="500" alt="" title="" /></div>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Anders</span>, watching the expressions
on Judy's face, felt the
strangeness descend on him. He
was back in the nightmare perception
of that moment in his
room. This time it was as though
he were watching a machine in
a laboratory. The object of this
operation was the evocation and
preservation of a particular
mood. The machine goes through
a searching process, invoking
trains of ideas to achieve the
desired end.</p>

<p>"Oh, were you?" he asked,
amazed at his new perspective.</p>

<p>"Yes ... I wondered what you
were doing at noon," the reactive
machine opposite him on
the couch said, expanding its
shapely chest slightly.</p>

<p>"Good," the voice said, commending
him for his perception.</p>

<p>"Dreaming of you, of course,"
he said to the flesh-clad skeleton
behind the total <i>gestalt</i> Judy. The
flesh machine rearranged its
limbs, widened its mouth to denote
pleasure. The mechanism
searched through a complex of
fears, hopes, worries, through
half-remembrances of analogous
situations, analogous solutions.</p>

<p>And this was what he loved.
Anders saw too clearly and hated
himself for seeing. Through his
new nightmare perception, the
absurdity of the entire room
struck him.</p>

<p>"Were you really?" the articulating
skeleton asked him.</p>

<p>"You're coming closer," the
voice whispered.</p>

<p>To what? The personality?
There was no such thing. There
was no true cohesion, no depth,
nothing except a web of surface
reactions, stretched across automatic
visceral movements.</p>

<p>He was coming closer to the
truth.</p>

<p>"Sure," he said sourly.</p>

<p>The machine stirred, searching
for a response.</p>

<p>Anders felt a quick tremor of
fear at the sheer alien quality
of his viewpoint. His sense of
formalism had been sloughed off,
his agreed-upon reactions bypassed.
What would be revealed
next?</p>

<p>He was seeing clearly, he realized,
as perhaps no man had
ever seen before. It was an oddly
exhilarating thought.</p>

<p>But could he still return to
normality?</p>

<p>"Can I get you a drink?" the
reaction machine asked.</p>

<p>At that moment Anders was as
thoroughly out of love as a man
could be. Viewing one's intended
as a depersonalized, sexless piece
of machinery is not especially
conducive to love. But it is quite
stimulating, intellectually.</p>

<p>Anders didn't want normality.
A curtain was being raised and
he wanted to see behind it. What
was it some Russian scientist&mdash;Ouspensky,
wasn't it&mdash;had said?</p>

<p>"<i>Think in other categories.</i>"</p>

<p>That was what he was doing,
and would continue to do.</p>

<p>"Good-by," he said suddenly.</p>

<p>The machine watched him,
open-mouthed, as he walked out
the door. Delayed circuit reactions
kept it silent until it heard
the elevator door close.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">"You</span> were very warm in
there," the voice within his
head whispered, once he was on
the street. "But you still don't
understand everything."</p>

<p>"Tell me, then," Anders said,
marveling a little at his equanimity.
In an hour he had bridged
the gap to a completely different
viewpoint, yet it seemed perfectly
natural.</p>

<p>"I can't," the voice said. "You
must find it yourself."</p>

<p>"Well, let's see now," Anders
began. He looked around at the
masses of masonry, the convention
of streets cutting through
the architectural piles. "Human
life," he said, "is a series of conventions.
When you look at a
girl, you're supposed to see&mdash;a
pattern, not the underlying formlessness."</p>

<p>"That's true," the voice agreed,
but with a shade of doubt.</p>

<p>"Basically, there is no form.
Man produces <i>gestalts</i>, and cuts
form out of the plethora of nothingness.
It's like looking at a set
of lines and saying that they represent
a figure. We look at a mass
of material, extract it from the
background and say it's a man.
But in truth there is no such
thing. There are only the humanizing
features that we&mdash;myopically&mdash;attach
to it. Matter is conjoined,
a matter of viewpoint."</p>

<p>"You're not seeing it now,"
said the voice.</p>

<p>"Damn it," Anders said. He was
certain that he was on the track
of something big, perhaps something
ultimate. "Everyone's had
the experience. At some time in
his life, everyone looks at a
familiar object and can't make
any sense out of it. Momentarily,
the <i>gestalt</i> fails, but the true
moment of sight passes. The mind
reverts to the superimposed pattern.
Normalcy continues."</p>

<p>The voice was silent. Anders
walked on, through the <i>gestalt</i>
city.</p>

<p>"There's something else, isn't
there?" Anders asked.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>What could that be, he asked
himself. Through clearing eyes,
Anders looked at the formality
he had called his world.</p>

<p>He wondered momentarily if
he would have come to this if
the voice hadn't guided him. Yes,
he decided after a few moments,
it was inevitable.</p>

<p>But who was the voice? And
what had he left out?</p>

<p>"Let's see what a party looks
like now," he said to the voice.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">The</span> party was a masquerade;
the guests were all wearing
their faces. To Anders, their motives,
individually and collectively,
were painfully apparent. Then
his vision began to clear further.</p>

<p>He saw that the people weren't
truly individual. They were discontinuous
lumps of flesh sharing
a common vocabulary, yet
not even truly discontinuous.</p>

<p>The lumps of flesh were a part
of the decoration of the room and
almost indistinguishable from it.
They were one with the lights,
which lent their tiny vision. They
were joined to the sounds they
made, a few feeble tones out of
the great possibility of sound.
They blended into the walls.</p>

<p>The kaleidoscopic view came
so fast that Anders had trouble
sorting his new impressions. He
knew now that these people existed
only as patterns, on the same
basis as the sounds they made
and the things they thought they
saw.</p>

<p><i>Gestalts</i>, sifted out of the vast,
unbearable real world.</p>

<p>"Where's Judy?" a discontinuous
lump of flesh asked him. This
particular lump possessed enough
nervous mannerisms to convince
the other lumps of his reality.
He wore a loud tie as further
evidence.</p>

<p>"She's sick," Anders said. The
flesh quivered into an instant
sympathy. Lines of formal mirth
shifted to formal woe.</p>

<p>"Hope it isn't anything serious,"
the vocal flesh remarked.</p>

<p>"You're warmer," the voice said
to Anders.</p>

<p>Anders looked at the object in
front of him.</p>

<p>"She hasn't long to live," he
stated.</p>

<p>The flesh quivered. Stomach
and intestines contracted in sympathetic
fear. Eyes distended,
mouth quivered.</p>

<p>The loud tie remained the
same.</p>

<p>"My God! You don't mean it!"</p>

<p>"What are you?" Anders asked
quietly.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" the indignant
flesh attached to the tie
demanded. Serene within its reality,
it gaped at Anders. Its mouth
twitched, undeniable proof that
it was real and sufficient. "You're
drunk," it sneered.</p>

<p>Anders laughed and left the
party.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">"There</span> is still something
you don't know," the voice
said. "But you were hot! I could
feel you near me."</p>

<p>"What are you?" Anders asked
again.</p>

<p>"I don't know," the voice admitted.
"I am a person. I am I.
I am trapped."</p>

<p>"So are we all," Anders said.
He walked on asphalt, surrounded
by heaps of concrete, silicates,
aluminum and iron alloys. Shapeless,
meaningless heaps that made
up the <i>gestalt</i> city.</p>

<p>And then there were the imaginary
lines of demarcation dividing
city from city, the artificial
boundaries of water and land.</p>

<p>All ridiculous.</p>

<p>"Give me a dime for some
coffee, mister?" something asked,
a thing indistinguishable from
any other thing.</p>

<p>"Old Bishop Berkeley would
give a nonexistent dime to your
nonexistent presence," Anders
said gaily.</p>

<p>"I'm really in a bad way," the
voice whined, and Anders perceived
that it was no more than
a series of modulated vibrations.</p>

<p>"Yes! Go on!" the voice commanded.</p>

<p>"If you could spare me a
quarter&mdash;" the vibrations said,
with a deep pretense at meaning.</p>

<p>No, what was there behind the
senseless patterns? Flesh, mass.
What was that? All made up of
atoms.</p>

<p>"I'm really hungry," the intricately
arranged atoms muttered.</p>

<p>All atoms. Conjoined. There
were no true separations between
atom and atom. Flesh was stone,
stone was light. Anders looked at
the masses of atoms that were
pretending to solidity, meaning
and reason.</p>

<p>"Can't you help me?" a clump
of atoms asked. But the clump
was identical with all the other
atoms. Once you ignored the superimposed
patterns, you could
see the atoms were random, scattered.</p>

<p>"I don't believe in you," Anders
said.</p>

<p>The pile of atoms was gone.</p>

<p>"Yes!" the voice cried. "Yes!"</p>

<p>"I don't believe in any of it,"
Anders said. After all, what was
an atom?</p>

<p>"Go on!" the voice shouted.
"You're hot! Go on!"</p>

<p>What was an atom? An empty
space surrounded by an empty
space.</p>

<p>Absurd!</p>

<p>"Then it's all false!" Anders
said. And he was alone under
the stars.</p>

<p>"That's right!" the voice within
his head screamed. "Nothing!"</p>

<p>But stars, Anders thought. How
can one believe&mdash;</p>

<p>The stars disappeared. Anders
was in a gray nothingness, a void.
There was nothing around him
except shapeless gray.</p>

<p>Where was the voice?</p>

<p>Gone.</p>

<p>Anders perceived the delusion
behind the grayness, and then
there was nothing at all.</p>

<p>Complete nothingness, and
himself within it.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Where</span> was he? What did it
mean? Anders' mind tried to
add it up.</p>

<p>Impossible. <i>That</i> couldn't be
true.</p>

<p>Again the score was tabulated,
but Anders' mind couldn't accept
the total. In desperation, the
overloaded mind erased the figures,
eradicated the knowledge,
erased itself.</p>

<p>"Where am I?"</p>

<p>In nothingness. Alone.</p>

<p>Trapped.</p>

<p>"Who am I?"</p>

<p>A voice.</p>

<p>The voice of Anders searched
the nothingness, shouted, "Is
there anyone here?"</p>

<p>No answer.</p>

<p>But there was someone. All directions
were the same, yet
moving along one he could make
contact ... with someone. The
voice of Anders reached back to
someone who could save him,
perhaps.</p>

<p>"Save me," the voice said to
Anders, lying fully dressed on
his bed, except for his shoes and
black bow tie.</p>
